# MasterMindGame-AI-
Single Java console game of Mastermind with randomly set pegs at start
OBJECT OF THE GAME
The object of MASTERMIND (r) is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 
colored pegs. Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the 
code. The winner is the player who solves his opponent's secret code with fewer 
guesses.
CONTENTS
De-Coding board: featuring built in storage area for pegs, built in scoring table, and 
hinged shield to conceal secret code.
Code Pegs: Approximately 72 large round-headed pegs (about 12 each of 6 colors).
Key Pegs: Approximately 30 small flat-headed pegs (about 15 each of black and while).
TO BEGIN
Separate the Code Pegs from the Key Pegs. Decide which player is to be the 
Codemaker and which to be the Codebreaker. Position the board between the 2 players 
so that the 4 shielded holes for the secret code face the Codemaker.
GAME NO. 1 (1,296 permutations)
The play of the game goes as follows:
1) One player, known as the Codemaker, secretly places the 4 Code Pegs in the 4 
holes, which are then covered by flipping over the plastic shield to conceal them from 
the opponent's sight. The Codemaker can use any combination of the 6 colors he 
chooses. He can also use 2 or more Code Pegs of the same color if he wishes.
2) The other player, known as the Codebreaker, sits opposite the Codemaker and 
places Code Pegs in the 1st row of the Code Peg holes (closest to him). The 
Codebreaker is attempting to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the secret 
code.
3) The Codemaker responds by placing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 Key Pegs in the Key Peg holes 
on the 1st row as follows:
(b) A black Key Peg to indicate a Code Peg of the right color and in the right position 
(without indication of which Code Peg it corresponds to).
(b) A white Key Peg to indicate a Code Peg of the right color but in the wrong position.
(b) No Key Peg to indicate a wrong color that does not appear in the secret code.
.
There is nothing about the placement of the Key Pegs to indicate which particular Code 
Pegs are meant. It is part of the challenge of the game for the Codebreaker to figure out 
which Code Pegs correspond to particular Key Pegs. The response when 2 pegs of the 
same color appear in the secret code and/or in the Codebreaker's row can cause some 
confusion. The basic principles are that one Key Peg corresponds to one Code Peg 
and, that black Key Peg takes precedence over a white one
